# MailClient
This project is part of an exercise during a class where we were analysing Java sockets and synchronization. I created
a mail server that could handle main clients at the same time and it kept track of their mails and accounts. No gui was
created or a connection to a database was established. The main focus was to handle the multiple users connection to the 
server at the same time.
